# ET2QGIS

ET2QGIS is an open-source QGIS plugin for the analysis of eye-tracking data in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment.  
It was developed as a complement to the ET2Spatial tool, which converts eye movement coordinates into geographic coordinates.  

ET2QGIS is designed to be user-friendly and allow for easy integration and visualization of eye tracking data.  

The aim is to automate selected spatial analyses and visualizations of eye-tracking data generated by the ET2Spatial tool.

## Key Features

- **Data import**: Allows loading data (SHP) from ET2Spatial, including coordinate system correction and merging data into a single layer. The data is automatically converted to the WGS 1984 coordinate system.
- **AOI (Areas of Interest) analysis**: Records information about the intersections between eye-tracking points and defined areas of interest.
- **Attribute Visualization Duration (AVD)**: Creates maps with proportional symbols to visualize fixation durations, helping to identify areas where users were most focused.
- **Heatmap**: Generates a raster layer showing the density of points, allowing you to visualize areas with high and low concentrations of eye-tracking points.

## Technical Details

- The plugin is developed in **Python** and is designed for **QGIS 3+**.
- It uses the **qgis.core** libraries and is integrated into the QGIS environment.
- It is published under the **GNU GPL 3.0 license**, which means that it is freely available and can be further expanded and improved.
- The plugin offers an intuitive user interface that allows you to configure and run analyses from a single window.

## Basic Plugin Use

1. Select an **output directory** to save the results.
2. Load input **shapefiles** from ET2Spatial.
3. Enter a name for the dataset.
4. Select the desired analyses and visualizations (**AOI**, **AVD**, **Heatmap**).
5. Click the **Run** button to start the analysis.

- All sample data needed for testing are included in the downloaded ZIP file.
- The plugin saves outputs to folders in a specified directory.
