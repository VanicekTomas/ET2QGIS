# ET2QGIS

ET2QGIS is an open-source QGIS plugin for the analysis of eye-tracking data in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment.
It was developed as a complement to the ET2Spatial tool, which converts eye movement coordinates into geographic coordinates.

ET2QGIS is designed to be user-friendly and allow for easy integration and visualization of eye tracking data.

The aim is to automate selected spatial analyses and visualizations of eye-tracking data generated by the ET2Spatial tool.

# Key features
• Data import: Allows loading data (SHP) from ET2Spatial, including coordinate system correction and merging data into a single layer. The data is automatically converted to the WGS 1984 coordinate system.
• AOI (Areas of Interest) analysis: Records information about the intersections between eye-tracking points and defined areas of interest.
• Attribute Visualization Duration (AVD): Creates maps with proportional symbols to visualize fixation durations, helping to identify areas where users were most focused.
• Heatmap: Generates a raster layer showing the density of points, allowing you to visualize areas with high and low concentrations of eye-tracking points.

# Technical details
• The plugin is developed in Python and is designed for QGIS 3+
• It uses the qgis.core libraries and is integrated into the QGIS environment.
• It is published under the GNU GPL 3.0 license, which means that it is freely available and can be further expanded and improved.
• The plugin offers an intuitive user interface that allows you to configure and run analyses from a single window.

# Installation and use
• System requirements: Minimum QGIS version 3.30 and Python 3.9.5.
• Download the plugin: The plugin is available for download as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
• To install the plugin:
	◦ Extract the ZIP file to an empty folder.
	◦ Move the et2qgis folder to the QGIS plugins directory.
	◦ Launch QGIS and activate the plugin in the "Manage and install plugins" section.
	◦ Click the plugin icon to open the ET2QGIS36 interface.

# Basic plugin use
1. Select an output directory to save the results.
2. Load input shapefiles from ET2Spatial.
3. Enter a name for the dataset.
4. Select the desired analyses and visualizations (AOI, AVD, Heatmap).
5. Click the "Run" button to start the analysis.
• All sample data needed for testing are included in the downloaded ZIP file.
• The plugin saves outputs to folders in a specified directory.

# Output data formats
◦ Shapefile (.shp) for processed fixation data and raw data, with added attributes to distinguish participants.
◦ Raster layer for heatmaps.
